The fraudulent activities, such as identity theft, phishing, and account takeovers are becoming more complex and increasingly hard to detect, especially when fraudsters gain access to genuine shopper accounts making it increasingly difficult for fraud tools to identify the fraudulent purchase as suspicious. That’s why it’s more important than ever for businesses to implement robust security measures, such as fraud detection software, to protect themselves and their customers.
As a data scientist the objective is building a best performance fraud detection model that can identify the fraudulent activity in credit card transactions.
